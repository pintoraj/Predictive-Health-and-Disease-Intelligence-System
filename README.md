# Personalized Health System

## Overview
The **Personalized Health System** is a comprehensive healthcare platform designed to predict and provide insights for various medical conditions. The system leverages advanced machine learning models and integrates AI-driven insights for accurate diagnosis, medical recommendations, and patient care.

## Features
âœ… **Disease Prediction Models:** Predicts potential medical conditions such as:
- Diabetes
- Cancer
- Heart Disease
- Fetal Health Conditions
- Liver Disease
- Stroke
- Malaria Detection via Image Analysis

âœ… **Medical Insights:** Provides detailed information on symptoms, treatments, and preventive measures.  
âœ… **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup system with password encryption.  
âœ… **Interactive Diagnosis System:** AI-powered medical insights for both symptoms and disease-specific queries.  
âœ… **Historical Data Management:** Tracks previous diagnoses, medical interactions, and chat history.  
âœ… **Image Analysis Support:** Predicts malaria infection by analyzing uploaded images.
